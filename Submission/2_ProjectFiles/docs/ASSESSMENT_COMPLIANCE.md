## ⚠️ Minor Gaps (Not Critical)

### 1. Testing Documentation
**Impact:** Low (not explicitly required)
- No formal test suite
- Manual testing only
- **Recommendation:** Document testing in report

### 2. Code Comments
**Impact:** Very Low
- Some files lack detailed comments
- **Recommendation:** Add JSDoc comments to key functions

### 3. Offline Indicator
**Impact:** Very Low (app works offline)
- No visual indicator when offline
- **Recommendation:** Not needed, app is fully offline-capable
